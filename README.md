# SQL-Database-Querying-Project
This project contains SQL solutions for a lab-style assignment using Microsoft's AdventureWorks relational database. The lab simulates business cases from departments such as Marketing, HR, and Production, providing hands-on practice with joins, filtering, grouping, and data analysis. The SQL queries can be found in the file `AdventureWorks Database Querying` and the questions are included in that file and are written above the queries as comments.
